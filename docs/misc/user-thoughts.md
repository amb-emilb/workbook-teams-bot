## ðŸŽ¯ End Functionality Requirements

### These are the ONLY CORE IMPORTANT functionalities of our project:
- âœ… **A CONVERSATIONAL TEAMS BOT THAT CAN PULL DATA FROM WORKBOOK API**: We HAVE proven that this is working. Our bot can pull data and chat.
- **CONTEXT AND SEMANTIC INTELLIGENCE, USER-BASED CHAT PERSISTENCE**: This does NOT currently work. The bot loses context between EACH message. I am not certain if it has a SEPARATE context for each teams user either.
- **INTELLIGENT TOOLING**: We still have a lot of work to do on the tool functionality, but this precedes the CONTEXT and SEMANTIC INTELLIGENCE
- **POSSIBILITY OF DOWNLOADING / UPLOADING CSV FILES TO THE BOT FOR DATA MANIPULATION IN/FROM WORKBOOK**: This is currently NOT implemented. The bot generates a CSV, but it cant be downloaded, and you cannot upload anything TO the bot.

## Framework Requirements:

- OUR SOLUTIONS MUST WORK WITH OUR STACK: MASTRA AI, TEAMS AI SDK/BOTBUILDER, AZURE.
