## Comprehensive state analysis of Agent implementation

The following file contains instructions for Claude.

An AI teams agent fetching workbook data through API calls has been implemented. It has persistent memory and semantic recall utilizing PostgresQL, and its built on the Mastra AI framework / MS Teams AI SDK (botbuilder).

1. First step is for Claude to compare the two tests that have been conducted:

[ ] -C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\logs\comprehensive-tool-analysis-2025-08-30T12-06-54.log (todays test)
[ ] -C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\logs\comprehensive-tool-analysis-2025-08-27T13-25-33.log (test from 3 days ago)

Some **improvements** to tool selection (C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\src\agent\tools) has been made, but several issues still remain in relation to the reliability of exports in particular, e.g. the agent misses a lot of granular requests like "export all clients mapped with contact persons", proper tool selection issues, misalignment of expected tool usage vs. real functionality, and a general oversaturation of tool usage.

- Resource types can be found here: C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\src\constants\resourceTypes.ts

2. In extension of step 1, a comprehensive examination of exports from today's test should be conducted: C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\exports
[ ] - Several misalignments can be observed, such as one csvs being generated with an actual title, and the others with a generic title, double suffixing of csv (.csv.csv) and misalignment of requested data (as seen in the test) vs actual exported data.

3. Finally, a comprehensive remediation plan based on analysis of tests and implementation must be written in the docs folder C:\Users\EmilOtteBrok\Kode\Klaviyodb\workbook-teams-agent\docs
