**Test Framework**: 85 comprehensive scenarios per test run  
**Current Status**: Phase 6 Job Management Tools - Partial Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

The Teams AI agent has achieved **remarkable improvement** through systematic remediation. We have successfully completed **Phase 1 (Export Fixes)**, **Phase 2A (Tool Selection Fixes)**, **Phase 2B (Broken Tools Remediation)**, and **Phase 3 (Tool Consolidation)**, achieving major breakthroughs in functionality and reliability. **Phase 4 (Test Coverage Expansion)** is now beginning.

### Current System Status (Phase 3 Complete)
