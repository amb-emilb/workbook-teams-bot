## Priority 1: Critical Export Tool Fixes

### Issue 1: Double File Extension Bug
**Location**: `src/agent/tools/enhancedExportTool.ts:331`
- [x] **Fix double file extension bug**: Replace line 331 with extension cleanup logic
- [x] **Test fix**: Verify no .csv.csv files are generated
- [x] **Validate existing exports**: Confirm fix doesn't break current file naming

**Current Code**:
```typescript
const fullFileName = `${actualFileName}.${fileExtension}`;
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Remove existing extension before adding new one
const cleanFileName = actualFileName.replace(/\.(csv|json|txt)$/i, '');
const fullFileName = `${cleanFileName}.${fileExtension}`;
```

### Issue 2: Wrong Resource Type Filtering 
**Location**: `src/agent/tools/enhancedExportTool.ts:164`
- [x] **Rewrite processUserQuery() function**: Implement proper entity recognition logic
- [x] **Fix client relationship queries**: Ensure "clients with employees" returns client data (TypeId=3) not employees (TypeId=2)
- [x] **Test relationship exports**: Validate TEST 19 scenario "CSV of active clients mapped with responsible employee"
- [ ] **Add unit tests**: Create tests for all processUserQuery() scenarios

**Problem**: `intelligentContext.resourceTypes` returns wrong types for complex queries

**Solution**: Rewrite `processUserQuery()` function with proper entity recognition:
```typescript
function processUserQuery(query: string) {
  const normalizedQuery = query.toLowerCase();
  
  // Fix client relationship queries
  if (normalizedQuery.includes('clients') && normalizedQuery.includes('responsible employee')) {
    return {
      resourceTypes: [ResourceTypes.CLIENT], // [3] not [2]
      includeResponsibleEmployee: true
    };
  }
  
  // Fix "starting with" filters
  if (normalizedQuery.match(/starting with [a-z]/i)) {
    const letter = normalizedQuery.match(/starting with ([a-z])/i)?.[1];
    return {
      nameFilter: `^${letter.toUpperCase()}`,
      resourceTypes: extractResourceTypesFromQuery(query)
    };
  }
}
```

### Issue 3: Missing Name Filtering
- [x] **Implement post-fetch name filtering**: Add regex filtering after data retrieval
- [x] **Test "starting with" queries**: Validate TEST 40 scenario "Export only active clients starting with A"
- [x] **Add filter validation**: Ensure filter correctly limits results to matching names only

**Solution**: Implement post-fetch name filtering:
```typescript
// Apply name filtering after fetch
if (intelligentContext.nameFilter) {
  const regex = new RegExp(intelligentContext.nameFilter, 'i');
  resources = resources.filter(r => r.Name && regex.test(r.Name));
}
```

## Priority 2: Tool Selection Algorithm Improvements

### Current Problem
- [ ] **Document tool selection failures**: Geographic queries ‚Üí Wrong tools (advancedFilterTool instead of geographicAnalysisTool)
- [ ] **Identify semantic gaps**: Simple requests ‚Üí Complex tools (universalSearchTool instead of specialized tools)
- [ ] **Catalog export confusion cases**: Wrong data types selected for export requests

### Solution: Enhanced Tool Selection Logic
**Location**: Teams AI planner in `src/teams/teamsBot.ts`
- [ ] **Implement tool selection validation middleware**: Add interceptor to validate tool choices
- [ ] **Add geographic query routing**: Ensure Danish/location queries route to geographicAnalysisTool
- [ ] **Test improved tool selection**: Validate against failed test scenarios (TEST 14, TEST 31)
- [ ] **Monitor tool selection accuracy**: Track improvements in tool choice correctness

```typescript
// Add tool selection interceptor
const toolSelectionValidator = {
  validateToolChoice(query: string, selectedTool: string): boolean {
    const queryLower = query.toLowerCase();
    
    // Company queries should use companySearchTool (except geographic queries)
    if (queryLower.includes('companies') || queryLower.includes('clients') || 
        queryLower.includes('suppliers') || queryLower.includes('prospects')) {
      // Geographic queries should use geographicAnalysisTool
      if (queryLower.includes('danish') || queryLower.includes('denmark') || 
          queryLower.includes('copenhagen') || queryLower.includes('in ')) {
        return selectedTool === 'geographic-analysis';
      }
      return selectedTool === 'search-company-by-name';
    }
    
    // People queries should use searchContactsTool  
    if (queryLower.includes('employees') || queryLower.includes('contact persons')) {
      return selectedTool === 'search-people';
    }
    
    // Export queries should use enhancedExportTool
    if (queryLower.includes('export') || queryLower.includes('csv') || 
        queryLower.includes('download')) {
      return selectedTool === 'enhanced-export';
    }
    
    return true; // Allow other selections
  }
};
```

## Priority 3: Tool Consolidation

### Remove Redundant/Unused Tools

#### 1. ~~Remove `relationshipMappingTool`~~ **REVISED: KEEP relationshipMappingTool** ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP INTELLIGENCE**
**Analysis**: Despite 0 usage in test suite, this tool provides **unique relationship intelligence capabilities** not found in any other tool.

**Unique functionality that would be lost:**
- **Visual ASCII Tree Relationship Mapping**: Comprehensive visual relationship trees with hierarchical structure and connection strength indicators
- **Connection Strength Scoring**: Weighted algorithm (0-100) based on account manager (30pts), contact count (40pts), active status (20pts), email presence (10pts)
- **Account Manager Portfolio Context**: Shows "what other clients does this client's account manager handle?" - relationship context from client perspective
- **Recursive Sub-Company Discovery**: Configurable depth exploration (maxDepth 1-5) for complex organizational hierarchies
- **Multi-Company Batch Relationship Analysis**: Comparative relationship insights across multiple companies

**Why other tools don't cover this:**
- **companySearchTool**: Only basic hierarchy for single company, no visualization, no connection scoring, no portfolio context
- **hierarchicalSearchTool**: Basic company-contact relationships, no visualization, no portfolio analysis
- **portfolioAnalysisTool**: Employee workload analysis (top-down from employee), NOT relationship context from client perspective

**Zero usage indicates test coverage gap, not lack of utility.** Missing test scenarios like "Show relationship network for ADECCO with visualization" or "What's the connection strength for our top 5 clients?"

#### 2. **KEEP `geographicAnalysisTool`** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL TOOL FOR LOCATION QUERIES**  
**Analysis**: Despite 0 usage in test suite, this tool is **ESSENTIAL** for geographic queries like "Danish companies" or "companies in Copenhagen". 

**Evidence from test results**:
- **TEST 14 (08-27)**: "Show me all Danish companies" ‚Üí `enhancedExportTool` successfully exported 959 Danish companies
- **TEST 31 (08-27)**: "Find client companies in Denmark" ‚Üí `geographicAnalysisTool` successfully found 582 client companies in Denmark with detailed geographic breakdown
- **TEST 14 (08-30)**: "Show me all Danish companies" ‚Üí `companySearchTool` **FAILED** - could not handle geographic filtering
- **TEST 31 (08-30)**: "Find client companies in Denmark" ‚Üí `companySearchTool` **FAILED** - asked for more specific information

**Problem**: `companySearchTool` claims to support geographic filtering in its description ("Find companies in Copenhagen/Denmark") but **does not implement it**. The actual implementation only handles company name searches and responsible employee searches.

**Solution**: 
- [ ] Keep `geographicAnalysisTool` as essential geographic query handler
- [ ] Fix misleading description in `companySearchTool` to remove false geographic capabilities
- [ ] Update tool selection algorithm to route geographic queries to `geographicAnalysisTool`

### Consolidate Tools with Justified Overlap

#### 1. **CONSOLIDATE `hierarchicalSearchTool` into `companySearchTool`** ‚úÖ **JUSTIFIED CONSOLIDATION**
**Analysis**: While hierarchicalSearchTool provides unique bulk processing capabilities, it has significant functional overlap with companySearchTool's hierarchy features.

**Unique capabilities to preserve:**
- **Bulk company processing**: Handles "show me ALL companies with contacts" efficiently via single API call
- **Mass contact overview**: Simplified contact format for dashboard scenarios  
- **Responsible employee focus**: Filters companies with account managers automatically

**Consolidation approach**: Add `bulkMode: boolean` parameter to companySearchTool that triggers hierarchicalSearchTool's bulk processing logic when true.

**Evidence supporting consolidation**:
- Both provide company hierarchy data (functional overlap)
- hierarchicalSearchTool used successfully in 08-27 test (100% success) but not selected in 08-30 (tool selection issue)
- Technical consolidation feasible without major API changes
- Unlike other tools, this doesn't provide unique business intelligence - just different processing model

**Implementation**: Merge hierarchicalSearchTool's bulk processing logic into companySearchTool, preserving the efficiency benefits while reducing tool count.

**Consolidation Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **Feature Flag**: Add `ENABLE_BULK_MODE` feature flag for gradual rollout
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Baseline current hierarchicalSearchTool performance vs companySearchTool bulk operations
- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Keep hierarchicalSearchTool code available for 2 weeks post-consolidation
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test bulk mode with existing companySearchTool functionality

**Performance Assessment**:
- [ ] **Baseline Performance**: Measure current hierarchicalSearchTool single `getAllResourcesComplete()` call processing
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate companySearchTool individual API call performance degradation
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement bulk processing using hierarchicalSearchTool's efficient approach
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure bulk operations maintain <2s response time for <100 companies

**Rollback Triggers**:
- [ ] **Monitor**: Performance degradation >50% for bulk operations
- [ ] **Monitor**: Integration failures affecting existing companySearchTool functionality
- [ ] **Monitor**: User-reported functionality loss in company hierarchy features

### Keep Essential Tools with Test Coverage Gaps

#### 1. ~~Remove `bulkOperationsTool`~~ **REVISED: KEEP bulkOperationsTool**
**Reason**: Essential for data management operations (deactivating clients, updating contact info, batch operations). Zero usage indicates **test coverage gap**, not lack of necessity.

### Fix Broken Tools

#### 1. Fix `universalSearchTool` (0% success rate)
**Current Issue**: Intended as fallback but failing completely
**Options**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Fix implementation to handle edge cases properly  
- [ ] **Option B**: Remove tool and improve other tool descriptions to cover edge cases

**Recommendation**: 
- [ ] Remove universalSearchTool - other tools cover all use cases when properly selected
- [ ] Update tool selection algorithm to handle edge cases with existing tools

#### 2. Fix `performanceMonitoringTool` (0% success rate)
**Current Issue**: Implementation errors causing failures
**Solution**: 
- [ ] Debug and analyze core functionality failures
- [ ] Determine if tool is essential for system operations
- [ ] Either fix implementation or remove if non-essential

## Priority 4: Data Relationship Enhancement

### Problem
Missing abstraction layer for complex entity relationships causing:
- Client-employee relationship mapping failures
- Contact person assignment issues  
- Hierarchical data export problems

### Solution: Relationship Service
- [ ] **Create**: `src/services/relationshipService.ts` with comprehensive relationship mapping

```typescript
export class RelationshipService {
  constructor(private workbookClient: WorkbookClient) {}
  
  async getClientsWithResponsibleEmployees(): Promise<EnrichedClient[]> {
    // Fetch clients and employees in parallel
    const [clients, employees] = await Promise.all([
      this.workbookClient.resources.search({ ResourceType: [ResourceTypes.CLIENT] }),
      this.workbookClient.resources.search({ ResourceType: [ResourceTypes.EMPLOYEE] })
    ]);
    
    // Create employee lookup map
    const employeeMap = new Map(employees.data?.map(emp => [emp.Id, emp]) || []);
    
    // Enrich clients with employee data
    return clients.data?.map(client => ({
      ...client,
      responsibleEmployee: client.ResponsibleResourceId ? 
        employeeMap.get(client.ResponsibleResourceId) : null
    })) || [];
  }
  
  async getCompaniesWithContactCounts(): Promise<EnrichedCompany[]> {
    // Implementation for company-contact relationships
  }
}
```

## Priority 5: Testing and Validation

### Enhanced Test Coverage
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for each tool
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Implement tool interaction and data flow tests  
- [ ] **Regression Tests**: Create tests to prevent export data misalignment issues
- [ ] **Edge Case Tests**: Add complex queries and boundary conditions testing
- [ ] **Bulk Operations Tests**: Add missing test scenarios for essential data management operations

#### Critical Missing Test Scenarios for bulkOperationsTool
- [ ] **Bulk Deactivation**: "Deactivate all inactive clients from 2020"
- [ ] **Bulk Email Updates**: "Update email domain for all employees from old-domain to new-domain"  
- [ ] **Bulk Status Changes**: "Activate all prospects that meet criteria X"
- [ ] **Bulk Responsible Employee Updates**: "Change responsible employee from John to Jane for all Danish clients"
- [ ] **Bulk Contact Information Updates**: "Update phone numbers for all suppliers in Copenhagen"
- [ ] **Bulk Data Cleanup**: "Remove duplicate email addresses across all contact persons"

#### Critical Missing Test Scenarios for relationshipMappingTool
- [ ] **Visual Relationship Networks**: "Show relationship network for ADECCO with visualization"
- [ ] **Connection Strength Analysis**: "What's the connection strength for our top 5 clients?"
- [ ] **Account Manager Portfolio Context**: "Show me all clients managed by admin with relationship visualization"
- [ ] **Sub-Company Discovery**: "Map the complete organizational hierarchy for Novo Nordisk"
- [ ] **Multi-Company Relationship Analysis**: "Visualize relationship patterns for all Danish clients"

#### Critical Missing Test Scenarios for geographicAnalysisTool
- [ ] **Geographic Distribution Analysis**: "Analyze geographic distribution of our clients"
- [ ] **Location Coverage Gaps**: "What locations have coverage gaps and opportunities?"  
- [ ] **Regional Clustering Patterns**: "Show clustering patterns of companies in Scandinavia"

#### Critical Missing Cross-Tool Integration Test Scenarios
- [ ] **Geographic + Relationship Analysis**: "Show relationship network for all Danish clients with visualization"
- [ ] **Export + Geographic**: "Export clients in Copenhagen with their contact details"
- [ ] **Portfolio + Geographic**: "Analyze portfolio distribution across Nordic countries"
- [ ] **Bulk + Relationship**: "Update responsible employees for all clients managed by admin and show impact visualization"
- [ ] **Stats + Geographic**: "Database statistics broken down by country with coverage analysis"
- [ ] **Export + Relationship**: "Export client relationship network for ADECCO with connection strength data"

### Test Automation
- [ ] Implement automated test suite for export data alignment validation
```typescript
// Example test for export data alignment
describe('enhancedExportTool', () => {
  test('clients with responsible employee exports client data', async () => {
    const result = await enhancedExportTool.execute({
      context: { 
        userQuery: "Give me a CSV of all active clients mapped with responsible employee",
        resourceTypes: [3], // Should be clients, not employees
        includeResponsibleEmployee: true
      }
    });
    
    // Validate all results are clients (TypeId=3)
    const parsedData = parseCSV(result.data);
    expect(parsedData.every(row => row.TypeId === '3')).toBe(true);
    
    // Validate responsible employee data is included
    expect(parsedData.every(row => row.ResponsibleEmployee)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Success Metrics

### Revised Tool Assessment Summary

**Important Corrections**: After comprehensive analysis of tool functionality and user feedback:

1. **`bulkOperationsTool`** has been **reclassified** from "unused/remove" to "essential/test gap." Zero usage indicates inadequate test coverage for critical data management operations, not lack of necessity.

2. **`relationshipMappingTool`** has been **reclassified** from "unused/remove" to "unique intelligence/test gap." Provides visual relationship mapping, connection strength scoring, and account manager portfolio context not available in any other tool.

3. **`geographicAnalysisTool`** has been **reclassified** from "unused/remove" to "critical/test gap." Essential for location-based queries that companySearchTool claims to support but doesn't implement.

4. **`hierarchicalSearchTool`** has been **classified** for "consolidation" into companySearchTool. While it provides unique bulk processing capabilities, the functional overlap justifies consolidation rather than removal.

**Net Result**: Only 1 tool reduction (hierarchicalSearchTool consolidation) instead of the originally proposed 5 tool removals. The zero usage patterns indicate **systematic test coverage gaps**, not tool redundancy.

### Target Improvements by Phase

| Phase | Target Improvement | Current ‚Üí Target | Success Criteria |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 0** | Infrastructure | N/A | Feature flags operational, baselines established |
| **Phase 1** | Export Tool Success | 44% ‚Üí 70%+ | Zero data misalignment issues, no .csv.csv files |
| **Phase 2A** | Geographic Search | 0% ‚Üí 80%+ | Tool selection routes correctly to geographicAnalysisTool |
| **Phase 2B** | Broken Tools | 0% success tools ‚Üí 50%+ | universalSearchTool and performanceMonitoringTool functional |
| **Phase 3** | Tool Consolidation | 13 ‚Üí 12 tools | hierarchicalSearchTool functionality preserved in companySearchTool |
